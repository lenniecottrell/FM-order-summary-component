## Overview

This is my first completed challenge for Frontend Mentor. I plan on finishing more as a way to solidify and enhance my front-end development skills, and as an opportunity to learn more about React, CSS, and accessibility best-practices.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties and variables
- Flexbox
## My process
- I began by thinking through how I might structure each component of the card. Since I didn't have to worry about state, I only had to consider what I wanted my containers to be, and what could be individual components.
- I started by creating all of my components and making sure my folder structure was clean.
- I spent a little bit of time researching how to use SVGs in React, since I haven't worked much with SVGs yet
- I did the desktop styles first. I am interested in learning more about mobile-first development, so I will probably look into that before the next challenge. 
- Once I submitted, I got wonderfully helpful feedback from someone in the Frontend Mentor community, and I went back to make changes in my code based on their suggestions.

### What I learned

This project was an attempt to give myself a refresher on the basics of React and CSS, but I also tried some things I didn't know very well.

- I haven't worked a lot with SVGs. I know SVGs are popular and powerful, so I'm glad I decided to learn how to work with them instead of PNGs
- I don't have a lot of practice with CSS variables, so I made sure to use them in this project. Since the color palette was provided at the beginning, using variables made color selection extremly simple.


### Continued development

In future challenges, I plan to do refreshers on SASS and Styled-Components for styling, and practice using Grid layout. I'm also eager to learn more about accessibility and mobile-first design. I know those areas are broad, and I've only scratched the surface so far.

### Useful resources

- [Using SVGs in React](https://www.sanity.io/guides/import-svg-files-in-react) - There are multiple ways to work with SVGs in React. I ended up using an <img> tag, but here's an article with other methods.
